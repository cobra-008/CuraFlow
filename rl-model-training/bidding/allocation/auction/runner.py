"""Opening, running and closing one auction. RL-Steps section 7.

**One entry point for every trigger.** A real bed-release event, a CDC row, and a hand-typed
query all become a :class:`ReleaseEvent` and arrive here. The query does not get its own
implementation — if it ever does, the thing being tested stops being the thing that runs.

``mode`` is what separates them. Only ``LIVE`` holds a bed and moves a budget; every mode is
scored and logged identically so a shadow run stays comparable to a real one.

**How many rounds run is decided per auction, not by the profile alone.** RL-Steps' three
rounds assume its own worked scenario — a bed thirty minutes out, utilities good for ten.
:func:`round_budget` re-derives the cap from the actual release event, and the loop closes
early on quiescence. Three constraints, whichever is tightest:

* ``profile.max_rounds`` — the framework's cadence, an upper bound
* the bed landing — a round closing after ``predicted_free_at`` allocates an occupied bed
* the shortest eligible utility TTL — past it the auction is pricing stale vitals

The floor is one round. A bed ninety seconds out still needs an owner, and one sealed round
beats no auction at all.
