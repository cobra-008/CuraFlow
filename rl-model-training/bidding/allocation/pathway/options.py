"""Assembling what the three exits need, once per candidate per round.

This is the object handed to :meth:`StrategicPolicy.decide_q`. It exists so that the policy
**chooses among what it is given and never looks anything up** — the same discipline that makes
``FeatureSnapshot`` one immutable read per round. A policy that queried HDU itself would be a
second, unsynchronised read of the world, and it could contradict the Alternative Availability
component that already scored that same unit into the utility it is bidding on.

Built per candidate, not per auction, because two of the three fields are patient-specific:
alternatives depend on the patient's care needs, and the release probability is scoped to *this*
patient's safe waiting window. Only the underlying discharge rate is shared.
