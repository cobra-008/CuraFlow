"""Frozen types that cross layer boundaries. Imports nothing else from the package.

Three invariants are enforced here rather than by convention, because every one of them has
already been got wrong somewhere in the source documents:

1. **Absent is not zero.** ``Signal.value is None`` means the input was missing.
   ``RL_STEPS_END_TO_END.md`` D.0: *"A missing factor is dropped, never treated as zero. Zero
   means 'this patient is fine', which would rank an untested patient above a tested one."*
   A ``float`` field could not express the difference; ``Signal`` can.

2. **Caps carry their own sign.** Alternative Availability is ``-20`` and Resource Stress is
   ``-10``. Points are ``cap * score`` with ``score`` in ``[0, 1]``, so they come out negative
   and the utility is a plain sum. ``D.0`` writes the utility with minus signs in front of
   both, but Appendix C sums the already-negative values (45.4 + 23.7 + 15.4 + 16.7 + 11.2 +
   5.3 - 2.4 - 8.2 = 107.1). Following the prose would double-negate them.

3. **Components are scored per agent kind.** ``Operational`` (D.5) and ``Waiting/Delay`` (D.3)
   are defined differently for a surgical bidder than a medical one — that is the framework's
   design, not an accommodation. ``AgentKind`` is therefore in the ``Component`` signature.
