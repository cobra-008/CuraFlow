"""A post-anaesthesia care unit bed (recovery bay).

Named ``pacu_bed`` rather than the plan's ``pacu_slot``, so that every member of the family
reads ``<unit>_bed`` and ``ResourceType.unit`` can strip the suffix to reach the care ladder
without a mapping table.

**The data behind this one is worse than for the other beds.** ``P(no PACU capacity)`` is what
substitutes for physiological deterioration when OT bids — an anaesthetised patient is stable,
so the deterioration slope reads zero while the delay harm is real — and ``ot_room_status`` has
no recovery-area concept at all (BUILD_SPEC F-05). So PACU is both a resource whose scarcity
drives another agent's Waiting score and a resource nothing in the schema can currently count.
