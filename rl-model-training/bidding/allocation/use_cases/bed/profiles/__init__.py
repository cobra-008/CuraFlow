"""Resource profiles. Importing this package registers every known resource type.

The bed family, ordered as the care ladder in ``config/rules/units.yaml`` orders it:
``icu > hdu > pacu > resus > ed > ward``. Every one is auctionable — which bed a hospital
actually frees is not known in advance.

Only ``icu_bed`` carries fitted-for-purpose configuration. The other five inherit ICU's caps
and TTLs and say so, both in their ``notes`` and through ``Config.unsigned``, which reports
their caps status on every run.
