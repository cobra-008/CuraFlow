"""A general inpatient ward bed.

The bed type that inverts the model, and the reason the family is worth building:

* **ICU bids here, and that is new.** ICU is the natural bidder for a ward bed — it wants to
  step patients down to free its own capacity — and until Step 10 it was eligible nowhere,
  because Operational had no ICU formula (F-D). It does now, so this is the first profile
  where the department with the strongest claim on the resource can actually bid for it.
* **"Does ICU help?" becomes "is a ward bed sufficient?"** Clinical Benefit's 0.25 weight slot
  currently reads ``rules/icu_benefit.yaml``, whose question is inverted here. Step 9.
* **Ward sits at the bottom of the care ladder**, so almost every alternative is an escalation
  rather than a fallback. Scoring ICU as a comfortable alternative to a ward bed — quality
  1.0, "you need this less" — is exactly the misreading Step 8 exists to fix.

Registering the profile does not fix any of those. It makes them reachable, and therefore
testable, instead of hypothetical.
