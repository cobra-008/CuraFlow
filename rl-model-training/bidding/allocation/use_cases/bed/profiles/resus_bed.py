"""A resuscitation bay.

Auctionable because the family covers every bed the hospital might free, but it is the least
like the others, and the difference is worth stating rather than discovering:

**A resus bay is usually where a patient already is, not where they are going.** ER's bid for
an ICU bed is a bid to *empty* a resus bay. Auctioning the bay itself is the inverse
transaction, and only ER can plausibly bid for it — which makes a single-bidder auction the
normal case, not a degenerate one. A single-bidder auction still runs, still charges budget
and still clears against the reserve price; what it cannot do is discriminate, so its result
carries much less information than a contested one.
