"""The second bed — written first, deliberately, as the seam check.

``registry.py`` claims that adding a resource type touches only ``profiles/<resource>.py``
plus config rows, and invites the check: *"worth writing a throwaway second profile during
design purely to check."* This profile is that check, and it **found two leaks**:

* ``HospitalState`` was ICU-shaped — an HDU auction had to report its beds in a field named
  ``icu_total_beds``. Fixed by unit-scoping the dataclass and its parse boundary.
* ``load_config`` hardcoded ``caps.yaml`` while ``ResourceProfile.caps_config`` had zero
  readers, so every resource silently shared ICU's unfitted maxima. Fixed by wiring the field.

Neither lived in ``profiles/``. The docstring's claim is now true; it was not before.

HDU is no longer *only* the alternative pathway. It remains the fallback that half the
withdrawals in RL-Steps turn on — and Alternative Availability still scores it as one — but it
is now also a bed that can itself be auctioned, which is the point of the family.
