"""The deterministic bidding policy. RL-Steps sections 9-17.

**This is not a placeholder.** There is no trained network, and there cannot be one until
auctions have been logged, the caps have been fitted (B.13) and the reward's largest term has
a source (F-01). This policy runs first, generates the log that makes training possible, and
then stays permanently as the regression baseline and the safety fallback.

It emits ``alpha``, never a point value — ``Increment = alpha x (Ceiling - CurrentBid)``
(section 6). Four rules, each traced to the worked example::

    1  standing bid above ceiling      -> WITHDRAW    section 16: OT holds 105, ceiling drops
                                                      to 94, "no longer rational"
    2  ceiling at or below the leader  -> WITHDRAW    section 12: Ward's ceiling 76 is below
                                                      the standing 85; it cannot win at full
                                                      stretch
    3  leading                         -> alpha 0.25  section 13: "exposes only enough
                                                      priority to establish leadership"
    4  trailing                        -> alpha derived from what overtaking costs

Rule 4 is the one worth noting: section 14's alpha of 0.82 is not a constant, it is what OT
needed to clear a leader at 101 from 75 inside a ceiling of 112. Deriving it rather than
tabulating it is why this policy generalises past the worked example at all.

    Two methods, one set of rules. :meth:`decide` is the narrow bid-mechanics seam;
    :meth:`decide_q` is the full six-action seam and is what the auction calls when pathway
    options are available. ``decide`` delegates to it, so there is one implementation.

    **The bid arithmetic is identical either way, and that is deliberate.** ``decide_q`` adds
    *which* exit and *which* compete regime, never a different alpha — section 18's ladder is
    the regression baseline for the whole system, and a labelling change that moved a bid
    would silently invalidate it. The one lever that can change a bid is
    ``pathway.yaml compete.win_now_alpha_floor``, which is null by default.

    So for this policy ``WIN_NOW`` and ``CONTINUE`` are honest labels over the same
    derivation. Differentiating them by aggression is exactly the thing a learned policy is
