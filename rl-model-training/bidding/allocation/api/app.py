"""The routes. Thin by design — every one of them delegates to ``service``.

Nine endpoints::

    GET  /health                     liveness, plus the versions this process is running
    GET  /config                     versions, unsigned rules, available scenarios
    GET  /use-cases                  registered profiles and a query that resolves to each
    GET  /scenarios                  scenario names this process will accept
    POST /auction                    run one auction, full bid ladder returned
    POST /session                    run N auctions across shifts, burn rate returned
    GET  /auction/{id}               a run from this process's memory
    GET  /auction/{id}/audit         every audit row that run produced
    GET  /auction/{id}/explain       the full derivation, as text/plain

The request models validate shape; ``service`` validates meaning and raises
:class:`~allocation.api.service.ApiError` with the status it wants. One exception handler maps
that to a response, so no route needs its own try/except and no failure reaches the client as
an unlabelled 500.

DESCRIPTION = """
HTTP surface over the HOSPILOT allocation auction.

Every number here comes from the same functions the CLI calls. Two things to know before
reading a response:

* **`mode: live` is refused** (403). The shipped data source serves three invented Appendix C
  patients; a live auction would hold a real bed for people who do not exist.
* **Nothing is persisted.** The `allocation.*` tables do not exist yet (F-02), and no episode
  can complete because no mortality column exists (F-01). Every response says so.
* **`policy: rl` needs a process started with `--policy`**, and shadows unless that process
  also had `--live-policy`. `GET /health` reports both, and every response names the policy
  that actually decided it.
