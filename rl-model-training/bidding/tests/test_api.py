"""The HTTP surface. Every test here is about the wrapper, never the mechanism.

The auction is already covered by ``test_auction.py`` against RL-Steps section 18. What is
untested until now is the *translation*: that a JSON body reaches the same functions the CLI
reaches, that the answer is complete enough to check without re-running, and — the part with
teeth — that the CLI's escape hatches did not become remotely reachable when they grew a port.

Three properties are asserted here that exist nowhere else:

* ``mode: live`` is refused, so the fixture patients cannot reach a real bed over HTTP
* a scenario is addressed by **name**, so a request body cannot name a path
* HTTP and CLI agree on the same inputs — one implementation, not two
