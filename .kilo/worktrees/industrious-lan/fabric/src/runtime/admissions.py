"""Inpatient admissions, discharge readiness, and discharge summaries.

`admission` and `discharge_ready` are streamed entities, so per-record state lives
in the backend's internal DB. What's here are the cohort questions — who is discharge
eligible, how many will clear within N hours — plus the proposals.

Static sub-paths are declared before `/{admission_id}` so they aren't shadowed.
