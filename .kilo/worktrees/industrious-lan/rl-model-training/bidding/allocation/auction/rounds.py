"""One bidding round. RL-Steps sections 9-17.

**Agents act in descending order of standing bid, and a later actor sees an earlier actor's
raise.** That is not a detail — it is what makes the worked example come out::

    round 2   ER 85 first  -> 101        section 13
              OT 75 next, sees 101       section 14: "Highest bid = 101"  -> 105
              Ward 55 last, ceiling 76   section 12: cannot win           -> withdraw

    round 3   OT 105 first, ceiling 94   section 16: no longer rational   -> withdraw
              ER 101 next, now unopposed section 17: closes               -> 118

With any other ordering the auction produces different numbers. Leader-first is also the
natural reading of an ascending multi-round auction: the standing leader commits, the others
respond.

**Rounds do not stop early when one bidder remains.** Section 17 has ER alone and still
raising from 101 to 118 against the reserve. Ending the auction the moment competition
disappears would hand a scarce bed over at the opening bid.
