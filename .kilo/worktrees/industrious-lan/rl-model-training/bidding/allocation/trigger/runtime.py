"""The end-to-end sequence. Query in, logged auction out.

    2  ingest        one read of the world                   RL-Steps 1
    3  utility       8 components -> points                  RL-Steps 2, 8
    4  ceiling       willingness to compete                  RL-Steps 8.2 / D.9
    5  budget        Base x Demand x Fairness x Scarcity     RL-Steps 4
    6  auction       3 rounds, sealed first                  RL-Steps 9-18
    7  settlement    Bid x Contention x Outcome x Rate       RL-Steps 19
    8  audit         rows, validated                         BUILD_SPEC 7
    9  reward        scheduled, not scored                   RL-Steps 23-24

Nothing here computes anything. Every number comes from a layer that is separately tested;
this module sequences them and records what happened. If a formula ever appears in this file,
it is in the wrong place — the layer that owns it has been bypassed.
