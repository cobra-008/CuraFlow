"""The reward — what the hospital observed after the allocation.

*"The auction result itself does not tell RL whether its policy was good."*

The best-supplied part of the framework and the most fragile at the same time: eight of the
nine section 23 terms map to live tables, and the ninth decides the sign of the episode.

    transferred_to_target_unit  +50   ipd_admissions
    patient_stabilised     +40   vitals
    boarding_reduced       +15   visits
    cubicle_released       +10   beds
    no_mortality           +30   NOTHING  <- F-01
    safely_held            +10   ot_room_status
    second_bed_opened      +15   beds
    surgery_not_cancelled  +20   ot_surgery_schedule
    no_staffing_violation  +10   staff_roster

Until a disposition field exists, every episode is incomplete and
:func:`~allocation.reward.episode.trainable` returns nothing. That is the honest state, and
imputing the missing term would make the policy optimistic about precisely the outcome it
exists to avoid.
