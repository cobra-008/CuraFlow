"""An emergency department cubicle.

The bed with the sharpest naming hazard in the family. ``ed`` names a *unit*; ``er`` names an
:class:`~allocation.contracts.AgentKind`. A query like *"should ER or OT get the ICU bed?"*
mentions ER as a bidder, not as a destination — so ``"er"`` is deliberately **not** a
qualifier here. Including it would make that sentence name two resources, and the matcher
raises on that rather than picking one, turning a perfectly clear query into an error.

``"emergency"`` alone is excluded for the same reason: it qualifies the situation as often as
the unit.

ED cubicles are also what ER's *boarding count* measures. Auctioning one allocates the
resource whose scarcity already feeds Resource Stress and ER's Operational score, so an ED-bed
auction reads its own pressure as an input. That is coherent — occupancy genuinely should
raise the value of the next cubicle — but it is worth knowing before reading the numbers.
