"""The founding use case, and now one bed among six.

    "ER, OT, and ICU/Ward demand compete for one limited ICU bed. RL learns who should
     receive the bed while balancing survival, throughput, waiting time, cancellations,
     and financial impact."

That sentence is the *use case*, and it selects this profile. It is the only bed in the family
whose caps, TTLs and horizon were chosen for it rather than inherited from it — which is why
it is the only one not carrying an UNFITTED warning. It is not the runtime trigger:
an auction opens on a bed-release event (``predict_discharge_probability`` or the
``change_queue`` CDC feed), because the auction is 3 rounds x ~2 minutes against a bed 30
minutes out, and utilities carry 10-20 minute TTLs. A hand-typed query fires the same
``open_auction`` path with ``AuctionMode.SIMULATION`` — one implementation, never two.
