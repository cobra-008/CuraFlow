"""Execution-strategy registry + coordination handlers.

How agents in one execution *level* coordinate (common goal, bidding) is selected
by the planner from ``strategies.json`` -- the JSON is the
allowlist/registry and each entry NAMES a handler. The executable coordination
logic lives here, keyed by that handler name, so adding a new strategy is

  1. add an entry to strategies.json (id + handler + description), and
  2. write one ``async def`` handler in STRATEGY_HANDLERS.

No changes to agents, planner, or builder are needed for a new strategy -- they
all talk to the generic AgentUnit interface (see graph.nodes) via the handler.

Handler contract (the B-ready seam)::

    async def handler(units: list[AgentUnit], state: dict) -> dict

``units`` is the set of agent nodes in one level; the handler owns the run loop
and returns the LangGraph state update (``{"results": {...}, ...}``) that the
level contributes. ``common_goal`` just commits every unit and merges -- exactly
today's behavior. ``bidding`` asks each unit to propose (a no-side-effect bid),
commits the highest bidder, and skips the losers.
