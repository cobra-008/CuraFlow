"""Shared graph state for a Hospilot session.

`SessionState` replaces the `context` dict that the old Kafka/A2A dispatcher
threaded agent->agent. The crucial difference: `results` and `_skipped` carry a
merge reducer so that agents running concurrently in the same LangGraph
superstep do not clobber each other's writes (a bare dict write from two
parallel nodes raises InvalidUpdateError).

`ta_results` (the large per-task result dict that holds candidate/bed lists)
is deliberately NOT a state channel -- it stays node-local so checkpoints stay
small. Only the compact agent `result` summary enters `results`.
