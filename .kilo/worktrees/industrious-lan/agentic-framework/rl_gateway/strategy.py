"""RL arbitration for the flow's `bidding` execution strategy.

The app already lets agents in one execution level compete: each proposes a bid, the highest
scorer commits, the losers are skipped (workflows/strategies.py `bidding`). This makes the RL
engine the arbiter instead of a plain max-score: the contending units ARE the bidders, we run
one auction over them, and the RL winner is the unit that commits.

Maps each department agent to the engine's AgentKind (icu→ward per §0), nominates that
department's strongest waiting patient as its candidate (nominate_candidates — REAL patients,
not placeholders, so winning_candidate_id is a real token the reward loop can observe), runs
the auction, persists it, and returns the winning node_id. Returns None on any problem so the
caller falls back to the heuristic bidding.
