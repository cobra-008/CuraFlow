"""Live end-to-end flow tests: environment, service gate, and the flow driver.

These run WHOLE PIPELINES through the real graph runner against the real
backends — Fabric, Hasura, Redis, the checkpointer and (per agent) Claude. They
are the counterpart to tests/e2e, which exercises individual task activities;
here the unit under test is the orchestration itself: level ordering, fan-in and
fan-out, conditional skips, and synthesis.

Because they need a running stack they are OPT-IN. Every test in this directory
carries the `live` marker (applied automatically below) and is deselected unless
you ask for it:

    pytest tests/flows -m live          # run them
    pytest tests/flows                  # collected, then skipped

If the marker is requested but the stack is not reachable, the whole directory
skips with a message naming what was missing — a missing service is an
un-runnable test, not a failure.
