"""End-to-end flow tests — six pipelines through the real graph runner.

Each test drives a whole pipeline and asserts on what the orchestration did:
which agents ran, in what order, whether the level barrier held, and whether the
run reached synthesis. Agent OUTPUT is checked only for shape — the numbers
depend on whatever data the stack is seeded with, so asserting on them would
make the suite a data test rather than a flow test.
