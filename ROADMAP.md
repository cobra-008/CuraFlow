# Hospilot Roadmap

Building an open-source Agentic AI operating layer on top of HIS/HRMS.

Hospilot is evolving from operational AI agents into a platform where agents can observe, predict, simulate, recommend, act, and continuously evaluate outcomes across healthcare workflows.

Our direction:

```
Observe → Predict → Simulate → Recommend → Approve → Act → Evaluate → Learn
```

This roadmap represents our current direction and will evolve based on community contributions, healthcare requirements, and real-world deployments.

## 🚀 Where We Are Today

Hospilot already provides the foundation for building event-driven healthcare operational agents.

### Available Foundation
