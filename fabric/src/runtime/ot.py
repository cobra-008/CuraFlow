"""Operating theatre — the queries and writes a per-record lookup can't cover.

Deliberately small. ot_room, ot_room_status, ot_schedule and ot_surgery are all
streamed to hospilot-backend and cached, so agents read theatre state from the internal DB;
those HTTP reads existed with no callers and were removed. What's left is the one
uncached table and the reschedule write. See input_transform/ot.py.
